						Hello! As you can see from the gigantic banner up there, my name is Sophia Pan. While most see a computer for the complex tool that they are, I have always been fascinated by the mechanics of its systems, languages, and intelligence. I truly believe that computer science is the field of the future, and thus, I have made it my mission to be part of that future. I never liked it when people say that they give 101% in all that they do because it just isn't mathematically possible, but I do give everything I do my all. In the infamous words of Ron Swanson, "Never half ass two things. Whole ass one thing." Whenever I make a commitment, I do everything I can to stick to it. I know I am not the most qualified, but I sincerely believe that I make up for my lack of experience with dedication. When I put my mind to something, I will not stop until I am successful, and because of that, I <i>know</i> that I am the best candidate for your internship.

							I know that I am a very driven person and, at the risk of sounding arrogant, have always thrived academically. I challenge myself to the most rigorous and demanding courses available with the mindset that it is better to take the challenging, riskier route and fail than it is to take the safer one and succeed. I would rather be left with the reassurance that I gave the course my all than the hollowing burden of regret and wasted potential. This year, in addition to five Advanced Placement classes (four in school and one as a self-study), I am also enrolling in the Dual Enrollment Program at my local community college. I know that the full workload is stressful and taxing to the point where the word "difficult" simply does not do it justice; however, I also have faith in myself and my abilities, and with unwavering persistence, inept time management, and general willpower, I know I will succeed.

									While the concept had seemed relatively bizarre to me, the ENGin program promptly presented itself as the enriching experience that it is. I had started the program talking to four Ukrainian teens, all of whom were around my age. Talking to random strangers to better engage their English-speaking abilities had seemed like an obvious advancement on their part, but I quickly began to realize the cultural growth on my end. As humans, we tend to become absorbed in <i>our </i>world only—our community, town, state, country—and forget how big the Earth actually is. There is an entire world beyond our surroundings, a world that most will never entirely see. ENGin, however, allowed me to broaden my perspectives and connect with people on the other side of the globe, giving me a new viewpoint and appreciation for life.

										As someone who had always been an avid lover of books, it feels nothing short of miraculous to be spreading the joy of reading. Before the program presumed a short temporary break at the beginning of September, I had been mentoring Lyricc, an adorable first-grader, every Tuesday and Thursday. While the sessions were usually short, I enjoyed learning small tidbits about her life—the pink, wooden music box given as a present, the chocolate lab that could be seen lounging on the couch, and her younger brother popping in every so often to say hi. It's astonishing how these short moments every week could give me such an extraordinary glimpse into a total stranger's life and remind me of the joy I had when I was Lyricc's age, absorbed in a book and all of the adventures it contained.

Growing up in a place of privilege, we often tend to forget exactly how fortunate we are. Among the various commodities we underappreciate is education, a resource so powerful and potent that for many, it is the golden ticket to a new life. The majority of the world, fortunately, seems to realize the importance of this wealth of knowledge with the right to education declared as a human one. However, while its significance is understood, the implication of its practice is unsatisfactory worldwide. Village Book Builders seeks to bridge this learning gap with the building of libraries in developing countries and communities and virtually connects students in those communities with mentors. I am mentoring two young girls in Belize, and the program has considerably expanded my horizons and reemphasized my appreciation for the education that I am lucky enough to have.

						Frequently Asked Questions
					</h3>
				<!buttons>
					<! q: greatest weakness>
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is your greatest weakness? </button>
					<div class="content">
						While cliche, I do believe that your greatest enemy often tends to be yourself. I know that I am a relatively intelligent, competent, and resourceful individual; however, I also am rather insecure and doubtful of my own abilities. I am not exactly confident or self-assured, and as a result, it may seem as if I am not qualified for a specific task because of my awkwardness. However, confidence is silent while insecurities are loud. Doubt and anxiety tend to kill more dreams than failure ever would.  Ultimately, I know that my insecurities do not define me nor what I am capable of, and thus, I will not let it hold me back.
					</div>
					<! q: million bucks>
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">If you found a lottery ticket worth 1 million dollars on the ground outside, what would you do?</button>
					<div class="content">
						If I found a lottery ticket worth a million dollars outside, I would probably check the ticket a couple of times just to make sure I am not being pranked. If the ticket is <i>indeed</i> legitimate, I would donate a decent percentage to charity because affluence is worthless if you do not do some good with it. I do not believe that I would spend it on anything particularly flashy—as I am not a very materialistic person—and would most likely save or invest the rest (because college is expensive and I have two younger siblings). However, with this newfound wealth, I would be able to eradicate financial worries (mostly college tuition) and adapt to a more environmentally-friendly and sustainable lifestyle. 					</div>
					<! q: why this job>
					<button type="button" class="collapsible"> How did you select this job to apply for?
					</button>
					<div class="content">
						I have always considered myself to be relatively aware of all of the social problems in our world. As someone who is part of the next generation, the <i>future</i> of America, it's inherently obvious to me that it is <i>our</i> duty to bring change and progress. Mr. Rogers once said that "We live in a world in which we need to share responsibility. It's easy to say 'It's not my child, not my community, not my world, not <i>my</i> problem.' Then there are those who see the need and respond. I consider those people my heroes.'” I strongly believe that computer science is the field of the future, but there is no future, at least not one worth living, if we do not advocate for change. Personally, that's why I find <a style="color:#ffd5cd" href="https://www.bayesimpact.org/en/" target="blank"><i><strong>Bayes Impact</strong></i></a> to be rather revolutionary, combining technology and reform. I greatly admire your brilliance of applying computer and data science to solving dire global problems, and I would love to be a part of that revolution for social justice and change. 
					</div>
					<! q: kitchen utensil>
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">If you had to pick a kitchen utensil that best describes you, what would it be?</button>
					<div class="content">
						If I were a kitchen utensil, I might be a measuring cup. They're always precise and reliable, useful for their dependability and consistency. Especially in baking—a science that involves chemical reactions between the various ingredients—measuring cups are particularly essential, acting as the foundation for the precision required to create baked goods. Virtually all recipes require some sort of measurement, and without a measuring cup, the results can be rather unforgiving and disastrous. 
					</div>
					<! q: animal>
					<button type="button" class="collapsible">If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?</button>
					<div class="content">
						I would like to be a wolf. They're majestically beautiful creatures who are fiercely loyal and protective. While wolves are remarkable leaders and work incredibly in groups, they can also survive and thrive alone. They are known for their determination and courage, willing to stalk their prey for hours before going in for the kill. Wolves are also complex and highly intelligent animals with extraordinary communication, devotion, learning, and social skills, one of the few species who educate their young, care for their injured, and live in tribes with their own histories, knowledge, and culture. Plus, they're the decedents of dogs, mankind's most faithful and adorable companions.
